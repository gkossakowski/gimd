                                  Git Message Database

gimd (pronounced gim-dee) provides a small distributed database layered on top of the powerful Git
version control system.

=== Building ===

Gimd recently switched to Simple Build Tool from Maven due to the fact that sbt treats 'simple' word
seriously.

You can install sbt according to these instructions:

    http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup

After you are done, enter root directory and type:

$ sbt

Sbt will compile project definition, download all dependencies and will enter to the interactive
mode. In the interactive you can type different commands that sbt will execute.

In order to compile Gimd jus enter: compile

Consult sbt's documentation for further details:

    http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/DocumentationHome

=== Testing ===

In sbt's interactive mode it's enough to type: test

Sbt will compile all tests and execute them.

Gimd uses JUnit 4.x and ScalaCheck 1.7 testing libraries at the moment.

=== Contributing ===

At the moment gimd is little bit in a state of flux due to Move to Scala 2.8 and sbt so contributing
can be difficult.

Anyway feel free to join http://groups.google.com/group/gimd-discuss

This section will get updated as soon as there is an official Scala release that does not crash on
gimd so contributing will become much easier.
