                                  Git Message Database

gimd (pronounced gim-dee) provides a small distributed database layered on top of the powerful Git
version control system.

=== Building ===

Gimd recently switched to Simple Build Tool from Maven due to the fact that sbt treats 'simple' word
seriously.

Enter root directory and type:

$ ./sbt update

Sbt will compile project definition and download all dependencies.

Once it's done type:

$ ./sbt

Sbt will enter to the interactive mode. In the interactive you can type different commands that sbt
will execute.

In order to compile Gimd jus enter: compile

Consult sbt's documentation for further details:

    http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/DocumentationHome

=== Testing ===

In sbt's interactive mode it's enough to type: test

Sbt will compile all tests and execute them.

Gimd uses JUnit 4.x and ScalaCheck 1.7 testing libraries at the moment.

=== Contributing ===

At the moment gimd is little bit in a state of flux due to Move to Scala 2.8 and sbt so contributing
can be difficult.

Anyway feel free to join http://groups.google.com/group/gimd-discuss

This section will get updated as soon as there is an official Scala release that does not crash on
gimd so contributing will become much easier.
